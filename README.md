# HR-Related Analysis for multiple departments

## Project Overview
During my Data Analytics course at Turing College, one sprint involved soft skills and communication practice. For this task, we were given a dataset and asked to create 2 presentations, one for the Executive Suite, and another for a department from a small selection. Here, I chose the HR department and created an analysis project with a focus on employees and other HR-related aspects.

This project involved delivering two dashboards and presentations, specifically tailored for each audience group. These can be found in the links below:

#### Executive Suite
* Static Looker Dashboard found [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/3eee2625-4f42-4e9e-bbd3-01c4ca3d5864)
* Google Slides presentation found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18G1f8xqKkNzZJb5_jpPK9qmzBxFhKom0ebzBglPXF2E/edit?usp=sharing)

#### HR Department
* Interactive Looker Dashboard found [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/0b08e297-8d26-4712-b56c-cf585f275af7)
* Google Slides presentation found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gYHXTqVqdyq-SeEWNigezQsd0GM5zpED1rO8eZwuBog/edit?usp=sharing)

### Techniques demonstrated

* General SQL syntax (Queries found in this repo, [Employees.sql](https://github.com/LuMaJe/HR-Exec-Analysis/blob/main/employees.sql) and [Departments.sql](https://github.com/LuMaJe/HR-Exec-Analysis/blob/main/departments.sql) )
* CTE's and Joins
* Static and Interactive Data visualization in Looker Studio
* Adaptation of presentations for audiences of differing levels of data literacy.

## Personal Reflections

I feel that I learned some valuable lessons with this project. The most impactful concept that I gained an appreciation for would be how something as small as delivering the presentation to two differing groups can have such an impact on the approach of the presentation. It forced me to think about how much time the audience(s) would have at their disposal to work through the material, leading to the static and interactive versions of the dashboards. Also, the language used and the level of complexity during the presentations would of course have to be modified. I really enjoy finding simple analogies to explain difficult concepts, yet I'm also a fan of the finer details, so this project was a great test for my ability to find the balance between simplicity and detail and their appropriate use-cases.
