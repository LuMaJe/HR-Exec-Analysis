# HR-Related Analysis for multiple departments

## Project Overview
During my Data Analytics course at Turing College, one sprint involved soft skills and communication practice. For this task, we were given a dataset and asked to create 2 presentations, one for the Executive Suite, and another for a department from a small selection. Here, I chose the HR department and created an analysis project with a focus on employees and other HR-related aspects.

This project involved delivering two dashboards and presentations, specifically tailored for each audience group. These can be found in the links below:

#### Executive Suite
* Static Looker Dashboard found [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/3eee2625-4f42-4e9e-bbd3-01c4ca3d5864)
* Google Slides presentation found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18G1f8xqKkNzZJb5_jpPK9qmzBxFhKom0ebzBglPXF2E/edit?usp=sharing)

#### HR Department
* Interactive Looker Dashboard found [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/0b08e297-8d26-4712-b56c-cf585f275af7)
* Google Slides presentation found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gYHXTqVqdyq-SeEWNigezQsd0GM5zpED1rO8eZwuBog/edit?usp=sharing)

### Techniques demonstrated

* General SQL syntax
* CTE's and Joins
* Static and Interactive Data visualization in Looker Studio
* Adaptation of presentations for audiences of differing levels of data literacy.
